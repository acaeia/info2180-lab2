            To provide a short synopsis: <br>
            After being aggressively rejected, Momo Ayase finds herself sulking when she stumbles across a boy being bullied. 
            Saved by her rash kindness, the alien-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about extraterrestrial interests he believes they share. 
            Rejecting his claims, Ayase proclaimed that she instead is a believer in ghosts, starting an argument between the two over which is real.
           </p>
          <p>
            In a bet to determine who is correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the extraterrestrial and the supernatural—Ayase visiting the former and the boy visiting the latter. When the two reach their respective places, it turns out that neither was wrong and that both aliens and ghosts do exist.
            This marks the beginning of Ayase and the boy's adventure, as they attempt to fix the surreal, supernatural, and extraterrestrial elements around them to return to a normal life.

            Short answer? Yes. <br>
            Maomao, an apothecary's daughter, has been plucked from her peaceful life and sold to the lowest echelons of the imperial court. Now merely a maid, Maomao settles into her new mundane life and hides her extensive knowledge of medicine in order to avoid any unwanted attention.
            Not long after Maomao's arrival, the emperor's infant children inexplicably begin to experience grave symptoms—almost as if a curse has been cast. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The curious Maomao easily solves the mystery and, to remain out of the limelight, attempts to leave an anonymous tip. Unfortunately, the dashing and perceptive eunuch Jinshi sees through it and manages to single her out.
            In recognition of her talent, Maomao is promoted to lady-in-waiting for the emperor's favorite concubine, Gyokuyou. As Maomao continues to remedy the numerous ailments afflicting the imperial court, her pharmaceutical expertise quickly proves indispensable.
